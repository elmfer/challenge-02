            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Fernando, a passionate programmer, who usually goes under the <strong>ELMFER</strong> pename. I have learned to code in Java, C++, Python, and recently HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create this website.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I mostly do is Minecraft Modding. I had created and published a mod called Parkour Recorder on CurseForge that allows you to record your player's actions so that it can be played back at a later time.

                My mission is to create software to solve problems and entertain people through software.
